    "# Playing Atari games using DQN \n",
    "\n",
    "Atari 2600 is a popular video game console from a game company called Atari. The Atari game console provides several popular games such as pong, space invaders, Ms Pacman, break out, centipede and many more. In this section, we will learn how to build the deep Q network for playing the Atari games. First, let's understand the architecture of DQN for playing the Atari games. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Architecture of DQN\n",
    "In the Atari environment, the image of the game screen is the state of the environment. So, we just feed the image of the game screen as an input to the DQN and it returns the Q value of all the actions in the state. Since we are dealing with the images, instead of using the vanilla deep neural network for approximating the Q value, we can use the convolutional neural network (CNN) since the convolutional neural network is very effective for handling images.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, now our DQN is the convolutional neural network. We feed the image of the game screen (game state) as an input to the convolutional neural network and it outputs the Q value of all the actions in the state.\n",
    "\n",
    "As shown in the below figure, given the image of the game screen (game state), the convolutional layers extract features from the image and produce a feature map. Next, we flatten the feature map and feed the flattened feature map as an input to the feedforward network. The feedforward network takes this flattened feature map as an input and returns the Q value of all the actions in the state: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![title](Images/4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that here we don't perform pooling operation. A pooling operation is useful when we perform tasks such as object detection, image classification and so on where we don't consider the position of the object in the image and we just want to know whether the desired object is present in the image. For example, if we want to identify whether there is a dog in an image, we only look for whether a dog is present in the image and we don't check the position of the dog in the image. Thus, in this case, pooling operation is used to identify whether there is a dog in the image irrespective of the position of the dog.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in our setting, pooling operation should not be performed. Because to understand the current game screen (state), the position is very important. For example, in a Pong game, we just don't want to classify if there is a ball in the game screen. We want to know the position of the ball so that we can take better action. Thus, we don't include the pooling operation in our DQN architecture. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have understood the architecture of DQN to play the Atari games, in the next section, we will start implementing them. \n",

    "We learned that we feed the game state (image of the game screen) as an input to the DQN which is the convolutional neural network and it outputs the Q value of all the actions in the state. However, directly feeding the raw game screen image is not efficient, since the raw game screen size will be 210 x 160 x 3. This will be computationally expensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid this, we preprocess the game screen and then feed the preprocessed game screen to the DQN. First, we crop and resize the game screen image, convert the image to grayscale, normalize and then reshape the image to 88 x 80 x 1. Next, we feed this pre-processed game screen image as an input to the convolutional network (DQN) which returns the Q value.\n",
